# Student Performance Dashboard

## Project Overview  
This project is a web-based **Student Performance Dashboard** designed to visualize and analyze student academic performance across semesters. It includes a login and signup system, a student data management interface, and an analytics dashboard with interactive charts. The application fetches data from a backend API (`/api/students`) and displays key metrics like CGPA, attendance, and semester-wise grades.

## Key Features  
- **Authentication**: Login and signup pages for secure access  
- **Student Management**: View and manage student records with CGPA, attendance, and grades  
- **Analytics Dashboard**:  
  - Total students, average grade, and attendance rate  
  - Interactive line chart for semester performance  
  - Individual student performance analysis  
- **Responsive Design**: Built with Tailwind CSS  
- **Backend Integration**: Fetches data from `http://localhost:6969/api/students`
