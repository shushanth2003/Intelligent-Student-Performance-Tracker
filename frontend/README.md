# Student Performance Dashboard

## Project Overview
This project is a web-based **Student Performance Dashboard** designed to visualize and analyze student academic performance across semesters. It includes a login and signup system, a student data management interface, and an analytics dashboard with interactive charts. The application fetches data from a backend API (`/api/students`) and displays key metrics like CGPA, attendance, and semester-wise grades.

### Key Features
- **Authentication**: Login and signup pages for secure access.
- **Student Management**: Table view to list students with their semester grades, CGPA, and attendance, with options to update or delete records.
- **Analytics Dashboard**: 
  - Displays total students, average grade, and attendance rate.
  - Interactive line chart showing performance trends over semesters.
  - Individual student performance charts with selectable options.
- **Responsive Design**: Uses Tailwind CSS for a clean, modern, and responsive UI.
- **Backend Integration**: Fetches real-time data from `http://localhost:6969/api/students`.
